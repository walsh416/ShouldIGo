Should I Go?

Created by Timothy Walsh, with assistance from Aslan Bakri, Brendan Chin, Robert Gerami, and Won-Kuk Lee for University of Rochester CSC210, Fall 2017.

To run locally: follow instructions in config.py to set debugging to True and switch from the AWS database to a local database (will need to uncomment and run /KILL_DB to initialize for first time).
